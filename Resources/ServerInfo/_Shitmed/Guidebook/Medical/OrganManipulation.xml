# Organ Manipulation
Organs carry important functions in the body, heart to pump the blood, lungs to breathe and eyes to see. But you can replace these organs for the benefit of the patient!


## Anatomy
Normally a body has the following organs:

<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanBrain" Caption="brain"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanEyes" Caption="eyes"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanHeart" Caption="heart"/>
</Box>
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanKidneys" Caption="kidneys"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanLiver" Caption="liver"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanLungs" Caption="lungs"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganHumanStomach" Caption="stomach"/>
</Box>

Certain species might have more or less organs, such as Diona having a combined organ that serves multiple functions, but this is the rough outline of what you'll see.
To remove an organ, you'll need to apply the respective Organ Removal surgery on it, which will then remove it without harming the patient.

However if you want to transplant an organ, you'll need to apply the respective Organ Transplant surgery where it originally was.

## What does each organ transplant do?

- Transplanting a [color=#a4885c]brain[/color] will take the patients soul from the current body. If you plant the brain into another body, that patient will take control of that body. If you have donor bodies, it is a great alternative to cloning!
- Transplanting a [color=#a4885c]liver[/color] will cure poison type damage from the patients body. Say goodbye to alcohol poisoning!
- Transplanting [color=#a4885c]lungs[/color] will cure Asphixiation damage from lack of oxygen. 
- Transplanting [color=#a4885c]eyes[/color] will allow the patient to see again, and heal any eye damage.
- Transplanting the [color=#a4885c]heart[/color] does not do anything special. But it is integral for blood circulation. If the patient has no heart or its in bad shape, they die very quickly.

## Where do I get more organs?

In the case that the patient's organ is missing or too damaged beyond repair, you are going to need a new organ for them.
For this you can use the Medical Biofabricator with some Biomass. Which can manufacture Biosynthetic organs for all species. (Or you can ask science for some fancy bionetic organs!)

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedicalBiofabMachineBoard" Caption="biofabricator board"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MaterialBiomass" Caption="biomass"/>
</Box>

By default, every Chief Medical Officer has access to a Medical Biofabricator flatpack in their locker.

## Why didn't the organ transplant
## do anything?

In the case that it does absolutley nothing, it means the patients body has rejected it, either because the organ is too damaged or its the wrong organ for the type of species the patient is.
Be sure you use organs in good quality and are compatible in the patient. Organs from the Biofabricator are designed to work for every patient if all else fails.
