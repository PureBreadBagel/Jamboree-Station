  9. Harm is defined as physical trauma, prioritized by its imminency and magnitude
  Unless a law defines harm, harm only refers to physical harm. You may choose if
  voluntary harm is considered harm as long as you stay consistent. Not considering
  voluntary harm to be harm is recommended. There is no distinction between direct
  and indirect harm.

  If you have a law that does not allow you to harm, then that law does not allow you
  to take an action that causes harm.

  If you have a law that requires you to prevent harm, then that law requires that
  harm be prioritized by likelihood and immediacy. Guaranteed immediate harm takes
  priority over highly likely future harm.

  If you have a law that both requires you to prevent harm and that does not allow
  you to harm, then that law prohibits even causing minor harm to prevent harm. If
  you have a law that does not allow causing harm, and a separate one that requires
  preventing harm, then they are prioritized by their normal law priority

  ## Examples
  (These examples assume that you have a law that both prohibits causing
  harm and requires you to prevent harm. Additionally, they assume you do
  not have a higher law priority that overrides the harm law, and that you have
  decided that you will not consider voluntary harm to be harm for the round.
  Laws typically specify who you cannot harm and who you have to prevent
  harm against. In these examples, you are the only person who the law
  doesn’t require you to prevent harm against, and you are the only person
  who the law allows you to harm.)

  1. Acceptable:
  - Taking no action to aid someone who is in psychological
    distress
  - Taking no action to prevent boxing matches between
    voluntary participants
  - Calling security to a fight
  - Attempting to get the people in a fight to consent to the fight
    when you realize you cannot prevent the fight without
    causing harm.
  - Denying a passenger access to the armory because it is
    likely to lead to harm

  2. Prohibited:
  - Hitting someone once to stop them from fighting
  - Harming someone who is trying to kill you
