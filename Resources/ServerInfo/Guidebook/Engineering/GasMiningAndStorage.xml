  # Gas Mining and Storage
When it comes to gasses, everyone on the station at least consumes some of it to a degree. Whether there has been an explosion accident in the bar and have been [textlink="lost to space," link="Spacing"] used in a burn chamber, or used for science experiments, the space station needs to be able to produce gas that has been consumed.

  ## Gas Miners
 Gas miners are the solution to this problem.

  Gas miners generate [color=#11dcf7] technically unlimited, room temperature gas[/color] and push it out into the area around it. They do not need any type of power, and constantly produce gas untill they reach their [bold]cutoff pressure[/bold].

  You can tell what type of gas a gas miner creates, its cutoff pressure and if they are currently creating gas by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
  Try inspecting them! You wont be able to tell what gas they make without inspecting them!

  Gas miners can be different for each type of station depending on its size, meaning its gas output increases on the size of the station.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMinerNitrogenStationLarge" Caption="4500 kPa"/>
  </Box>

  Gas miners can be easily sabotaged by getting unanchored by a wrench and tossed into space. Meaning [color=yellow]its important you keep an eye on them.[/color] As gas miners are [color=red] in limited quantity. [/color] They can not be replaced if lost.

  ## Gas Storage
  Gas storage tanks are used to store gas produced by the gas miners, and to make it available to other processes. They are found in Atmospherics.

  Various atmos processes insert and remove gasses from the gas storage tanks.
  For example:
  - The gas miner provides fresh gasses to the gas storage tanks, if there is room.
  - The recyclernet injects reclaimed gasses into the gas storage tanks for reuse.
  - Setups like the distronet and burn chamber remove gasses from the gas storage tanks.

  Gas storage tanks are designed to be able to be measured using a [textlink="Gas Analyzer" link="AtmosTools"].
  Because the outflow vent is a [textlink="passive vent" link="PassiveVent"], you can use a [textlink="gas analyzer" link="AtmosTools"] to measure the gas content of the [textlink="pump's" link="Pumps"] input, which is drawing from the gas storage tank.
